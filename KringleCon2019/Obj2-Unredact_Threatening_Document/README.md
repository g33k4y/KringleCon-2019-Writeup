## Problem Statment:

> 2) Unredact Threatening Document

> Difficulty: 1/5

> Someone sent a threatening letter to Elf University. What is the first word in ALL CAPS in the subject line of the letter? Please find the letter in the Quad.

td:lr Answer: **DEMAND**

==========================================================================================
## Solution: 

First you can find the [PDF](./LetterToElfUPersonnel.pdf) on the floor at the top left corner of the Quad

the letter subject and body has been redacted, but it was a poorly done redaction.

Highlight the letter subject line (we do not need the letter body) and do a copy and paste on a text file and you will be able to see the full text:

> Subject: DEMAND: Spread Holiday Cheer to Other Holidays and Mythical Charactersâ€¦ OR ELSE! 


So the answer is: **DEMAND**
